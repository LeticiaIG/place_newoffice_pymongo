Neighborhood Geo boundaries: European Cities
===========================================

A collection of jsons with coordinates that define each neighborhood. Thanks to HoodsProject.

As it was imposible to find geo data for neighbours, I drawed directly the polygons using google maps, and some wikipedia pages to get the boundaries of each neigborhood.

Hope it helps.


## Editor

I used HoodsProj to draw the polygons and get the coordinates. Hoods Proj seems disapeared now. It's modified, so when you click in submit map, it prints the JSON with all polygon's coordinates at console.

### Defining neighborhoods for new cities

Duplicate barcelona.html, rename it to your city name, change the neighborhood's names, and you will be able to select them from the editor and then draw the boundaries.
